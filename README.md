# MLQMC-FEM-PROD
Python source code that computes expectations of linear functionals of solutions to elliptic partial differential equations with log-Gaussian coefficients by the multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo finite element method (MLQMC-FEM).  The log-Gaussian coefficients are represented in pre-wavelet expansions and QMC by randomly shifted lattice rules is used.
